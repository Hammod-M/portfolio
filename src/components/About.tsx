            My journey into the world of web development began in the realm of
            freelancing, where I spent over two year bringing various projects
            to life, including e-commerce platforms, corporate portals, CRM
            systems, business card websites, and landing pages.
            <br />
            <br />
            Primarily specializing in frontend development, I also successfully
            tackled backend tasks using technologies like Node.js and PHP, along
            with various frameworks and content management systems.
            <br />
            <br />
            My experience encompasses active collaboration within development
            teams, where I not only executed my responsibilities but also
            engaged with designers, backend developers, and clients to ensure
            successful project delivery within deadlines. This experience led to
            team formation, where each member contributed, resulting in over 100
            positive reviews and loyal clients.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently, I contribute as a part of the team at vakhid.digital, a
            company specializing in the development and maintenance of CRM
            systems for freight transportation. Here, I continue to enhance my
            skills, utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as React,
            JavaScript/TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit. My contribution to the
            team aims at ensuring efficient and innovative web development.
